							<b>Me as a game developer:</b>
							As a game developer I have found that I prioritize fluid gameplay and intuitive controls in my work. I am dedicated to constantly improving my skills and pushing the boundaries of my projects through incorporating new elements and increasing difficulty. I actively seek learning opportunities such as reading programming books, doing tutorials and watching videos and podcasts on programming. In addition, I enjoy helping others and have experience assisting my peers in resolving programming issues.

							<b>Earlier programming experiences: </b>
							Before working on Unity I used to make flash games. I made many prototypes and participated in a few game jams as well. During my studies I have learned and used programming languages like Java, Matlab, Assembler and C++. I used assembler to code a weather station that could communicate and read values from sensors. I also used assembler to code a single button input interface project involving programmable LED-lit juggling balls. My first programming experience has to be when I in my childhood coded a bouncing ball on a Commodore64 by using examples from the manual.

							<b>My preferred game genre: </b>
							My preferred game genre revolves around engaging single-player experiences that challenge players with problem-solving elements. I have a particular affinity for puzzle games, although I also enjoy exploring multiplayer and cooperative titles to diversify my gaming experiences.
							With a background in utilizing server services like Firebase, Photon PUN, and MongoDB, I bring a strong foundation in creating immersive gameplay experiences.

							My striving to get better at writing clean and well-structured code. I am also trying to craft captivating games with an aim to get them polished and released. While I have a particular affinity for puzzle games, I also enjoy exploring various game styles and occasionally delve into multiplayer and cooperative titles. I strive to create unique and enjoyable gaming experiences that resonate with players and leave a lasting impression. To make games is more than a job its an artwork in itself.
